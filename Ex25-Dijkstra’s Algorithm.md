# Ex25 Finding the Fastest Route to a Charging Station using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
## DATE: 10-11-2025
## AIM:
To design and implement a java program that helps an electric vehicle (EV) find the shortest travel time from its current block to the nearest charging station using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.
## Algorithm
1. Read n nodes and m weighted edges, then build an undirected graph where each edge stores the neighbor and travel time.
2. Read the source node and the set of charging-station nodes.
3. Initialize a distance array with infinity and set the distance of the source to 0.
4. Use Dijkstra’s algorithm: push (source,0) into a min-heap, repeatedly extract the node with the smallest time, relax its neighbors, and update distances.
5. The moment a charging-station node is polled from the heap, return its travel time; if none is reachable, return –1.

## Result:
The program has been successfully implemented and executed.
It uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest travel time from the EV’s current location to the nearest charging station and correctly handles cases where no station is reachable.
