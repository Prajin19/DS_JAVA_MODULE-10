# Ex24 Shortest Path and Reachability in a Heritage Town using BFS
## DATE: 10-11-2025
## AIM:
To design and implement a java program that, given a map of attractions in a heritage town connected by walking paths, recommends:
The shortest number of paths (minimum hops) from a starting attraction to a target attraction.
The number of reachable attractions from the same starting point using Breadth-First Search (BFS)


## Algorithm
1. Read n and e, then build an undirected graph using an adjacency list by adding both u→v and v→u for each edge.
2. For shortestPath, run BFS from the start node: mark visited, track distance, and return the distance when the target is reached; if unreachable, return –1.
3. For reachableAttractions, perform DFS starting from the start node, marking every visited node as reachable.
4. Count how many nodes were marked visited to get the number of reachable attractions.
5. Print both the shortest path distance and the total number of reachable attractions from the start node.
